# web-components

## The Goal

Create and store code snippets of mostly HTML, CSS, JavaScript for future projects. Components will exist on their own html file, but most files will only include a single component for simplicity and organization

## The Components

I may include a list later, but these will be anything from animations and transitions to design trends such as neumorphism and glass morphism
